##Interactive Development Environments
#Laboratory Work #2

Mandatory Tasks:
----------------
*	Define 3 virtual tasks that your application is supposed to control
*	Create a GUI application with 5 standard controls (any child window control mentioned in book Windows Programming ed.5 is considered standard)

Objectives with Points
----------------------
*	Make controls to interact. At least 3 interactions **(1pt)** ex. on clicking a button a counter should start
*	Add 3 non-standard controls **(2pt)**
*	Creating a flappy bird

Application Creation Steps
--------------------------
First of all I want to say that I create the most played game FLAPPY BIRD! Or I recreated it! Maybe I will not claim so much points for this laboratory work because I didn’t manage all the tasks as it was asked but it was very nice work! I’m just proud of me! Ok, it was hard but very interesting. In the end I got a very good copy of flappy bird!

Ok, what I did! First of all I have used a drag and drop function for this application. From this point of view it was simple. After creation of basic things like START button and Score counter (at this moment they are just created, without any functionality) I putted in 3 timers: 1’st timer invalidate the function of redrawing of control (in this case the control is the Form1 where will be painted those pipes); second timer will create random those pipes; third timer will make the bird to fall down till pressing the spacebar and after leaving the spacebar to fall as well. So after that I manage all the functions and functionality of button and counter in order to let them work.
         
At this step my bird is ready to fly, it is very interesting, and exciting maybe because I did it but still. And you are free to try my application and to spend some boring moments by playing my flappy bird.

Conclusion
----------
It was the most interesting laboratory work that I did ever and ever! I really enjoyed doing it! I have learned a lot of things and features and implemented them in order to make my application to work in the right manner.  All things that I have planned, I did and I’m proud of me! It’s a nice experience for me and I think I will do a lot of things like this!
