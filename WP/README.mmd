##Topic: Basics of Working with Mouse. GDI Primitives. Bezier Curve.

Contents
--------
* Mouse
* Device context
* GDI Primitives
  * Line
  * Curve
  * Plane
  * Bitmap image
* Bezier curve

Mandatory Objectives
--------------------
* Draw few lines of different colors and weights
* Draw a Bezier curve
* Draw few plane objects (ex. circle, square, pie, polygon...) of different colors, weights, filled and not
* Draw 2 different objects using mouse

Completed Objectives With Points
-----------------------------------
* Draw a custom bitmap image **(1 pt)**
* Add a switch (button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects **(2 pt)**
* Draw a Bezier curve using mouse **(1 pt)**
* Fill an object with a gradient **(1 pt)**
* Use mouse as an eraser of a adjustable width **(2 pt)**

Application Creation Steps
--------------------------
*â€¢	First of all I've sketched my laboratory work on a paper. Designed all the buttons elements to control the drawing. After that I've added the elements. Then I've set their functionality step by step. And in the end I've added the properties to draw stuff.
