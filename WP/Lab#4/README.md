Conclusions
-----------

This laboratory work has very interesting task and I really enjoyed doing it. What I liked most is the fact how simple is timer using.

I think the work I did went smoothly and I had no problems. The process was really simple all the features that I have planned where done.

Well, this laboratory work was very addictive, my bubbles are very funny and the thing I like most is that they change color when they interact with each other.
