Application Creation Steps
--------------------------
*	For present app I’ve read almost all chapters from the recommended book (["Programming Windows, 5th Edition", by Charles Petzold](http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/)) in order to understand how to develop my ideas in such a way as to be understood not only by me. During the process I consult the documentation on the [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com) page and [Win32 Tips & Tricks] (http://www.catch22.net/tuts/win32-tips-tricks#ResizeNoMove).
*	I checked if the exact project I’m considering has not been done before.
*	This application proceed the same topic “Cats & Dogs”. So, application has one text label, one field input, here I add 5 buttons ( CAT button, DOG button, ADD button, REMOVE and CLEAR buttons), two static labels, two scrollbars (which change the height and the width of the window), two traversal scrollbars, the main menu (file, view, help).
*	In order to understand more clearly I made a wireframe model of my application general layout and functionality using paint. Here is the mockup I came up with:
