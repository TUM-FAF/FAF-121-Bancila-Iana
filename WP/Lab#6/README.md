Conclusions
-----------

Well, I can say that it was my first laboratory work based on C# language, and I enjoyed executing it. I used the Visual Studio IDE and Windows Forms Application, which simplify my work. I used drag and drop option in order to create the GUI and all buttons. This feature of Visual Studio IDE is very useful one, because you have to write only code for actions, not for buttons. The functions which I implemented in C# are pretty simple; they are basically all build in.  
I think that this laboratory work was very important, because it laid a good foundation, on which to build upon.
